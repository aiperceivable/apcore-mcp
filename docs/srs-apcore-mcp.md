## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification defines the complete functional and non-functional requirements for **apcore-mcp**, an independent Python adapter package that automatically bridges any apcore Module Registry into both a fully functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server and OpenAI-compatible tool definitions. This document formalizes 20 of 25 features from the upstream PRD (F-001 through F-020) into traceable, testable requirements organized by component module. P2 features F-021 through F-025 are deferred to a future SRS revision. It serves as the authoritative reference for implementation, testing, and acceptance of apcore-mcp v0.9.0.

The intended audience includes software engineers implementing apcore-mcp, QA engineers writing test plans, and project stakeholders evaluating feature completeness.

> **Note:** FR-STREAM-001, FR-EXT-001, FR-EXT-002, and FR-EXT-003 are defined in this document but not yet included in the traceability matrix (Section 9). The effective FR count is 84.

### 1.2 Scope

apcore-mcp provides two primary capabilities:

1. **MCP Server Bridge**: A `serve(registry)` function that launches a standards-compliant MCP Server exposing all apcore modules as MCP tools, supporting stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE transports.
2. **OpenAI Tools Export**: A `to_openai_tools(registry)` function that returns a list of OpenAI-compatible tool definition dicts for use with OpenAI Function Calling APIs.

The system reads apcore module metadata (`input_schema`, `output_schema`, `description`, `annotations`) and generates correct tool definitions at runtime with zero per-module code. All MCP tool calls are routed through the apcore `Executor` pipeline, preserving ACL enforcement, input validation, middleware execution, and timeout enforcement.

apcore-mcp does NOT reimplement the MCP protocol (it uses the official `mcp` Python SDK), does NOT define modules (that is apcore-python's responsibility), does NOT implement domain-specific wrapping (that is the job of `xxx-apcore` projects), and does NOT build an OpenAI API client or agent runtime.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

apcore-mcp is a thin adapter layer that sits between the apcore-python SDK and the AI agent ecosystem. It occupies a specific architectural position defined by apcore's SCOPE.md:

```
apcore-python (core SDK)
    |
    +-- Provides: Registry, Executor, ModuleDescriptor, ModuleAnnotations, error hierarchy
    |
apcore-mcp (this project)
    |
    +-- Consumes: Registry API, Executor.call() / call_async()
    +-- Produces: MCP Server (via mcp SDK), OpenAI tools list (pure dict conversion)
    |
    +-- MCP path --> Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, any MCP client
    +-- OpenAI path --> OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI, any OpenAI-compatible platform
```

apcore-mcp is the first adapter in a planned family (apcore-a2a is future). It depends on the `apcore` package for module metadata and execution, and on the `mcp` package for MCP protocol implementation. It has no dependency on the `openai` package at runtime.

### 2.2 Product Functions (High-Level Summary)

1. **Schema Conversion**: Convert apcore `input_schema` (JSON Schema with potential `$defs`/`$ref`) to clean schemas for MCP and OpenAI consumption.
2. **Annotation Mapping**: Map apcore `ModuleAnnotations` to MCP `ToolAnnotations` and optionally embed in OpenAI tool descriptions.
3. **MCP Server Launch**: Create and start an MCP Server via `serve()` with configurable transport (stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE).
4. **Execution Routing**: Route MCP tool calls through the apcore `Executor` pipeline with full ACL, validation, and middleware.
5. **Error Mapping**: Translate apcore error hierarchy to structured MCP error responses.
6. **OpenAI Export**: Export registry modules as OpenAI-compatible tool definition dicts via `to_openai_tools()`.
7. **CLI Entry Point**: Provide `python -m apcore_mcp` for launching the server without writing Python code.
8. **Dynamic Registration**: Reflect runtime registry changes in the MCP tool list.
9. **Logging**: Structured logging for tool calls, errors, and server lifecycle events.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

| Persona | Role | Experience | Primary Interaction |
|---------|------|------------|---------------------|
| **Maya** (Module Developer) | Writes apcore modules, wants AI agent integration | 3+ years Python, familiar with Pydantic, new to MCP | Calls `serve(registry)` or `to_openai_tools(registry)` |
| **David** (xxx-apcore Project Dev) | Builds domain-specific apcore projects (comfyui-apcore, etc.) | 5+ years Python, expert in domain, familiar with apcore | Adds apcore-mcp as dependency, calls `serve()` with pre-configured Executor |
| **Alex** (AI Agent Builder) | Integrates external tools into Claude/GPT workflows | Familiar with MCP clients and OpenAI function calling | Connects MCP client to apcore-mcp server, or receives OpenAI tool dicts |

### 2.4 Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Rationale |
|----|-----------|-----------|
| C-01 | Must use official `mcp` Python SDK for MCP protocol implementation | MCP protocol is complex; reimplementation is out of scope and error-prone |
| C-02 | Must use apcore `Executor` for all tool call routing | ACL, validation, and middleware guarantees must be preserved |
| C-03 | Core logic must not exceed 1,200 lines (excluding tests and docs) | Thin adapter design principle; complexity belongs in apcore-python and mcp SDK |
| C-04 | Python >= 3.11 required | Aligns with apcore-python minimum; needed for modern type hints, `match`, and `ExceptionGroup` |
| C-05 | Authentication bridges to apcore ACL, not replaces it | Optional `JWTAuthenticator` validates tokens at HTTP layer and injects `Identity` into `Context` for the Executor's ACL. No OAuth flows, API key management, or user stores. |
| C-06 | `to_openai_tools()` must have zero runtime dependency on `openai` package | Maximum interoperability; returns plain dicts |

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

| ID | Assumption/Dependency | Type |
|----|----------------------|------|
| A-01 | apcore-python SDK API (`Registry`, `Executor`, `ModuleDescriptor`, `ModuleAnnotations`) is stable and will not undergo breaking changes during development | Assumption |
| A-02 | The `mcp` Python SDK (>= 1.0.0) provides stable APIs for tool registration, transport configuration, and error handling | Assumption |
| A-03 | MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) correctly implement the MCP protocol for tool discovery and invocation | Assumption |
| A-04 | apcore modules produce JSON-serializable output dicts from their `execute()` methods | Assumption |
| A-05 | Python >= 3.11 is available in the target deployment environment | Assumption |
| D-01 | `apcore` package >= 0.13.0 | Dependency |
| D-02 | `mcp` package >= 1.0.0 | Dependency |
| D-03 | `openai` package (optional, not required at runtime) | Dependency |

| **ID** | FR-SCHEMA-001 |
| **Title** | Convert apcore input_schema to MCP-compatible inputSchema |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Traces to** | F-001 |

**Description:** The `SchemaConverter.convert_input_schema()` method shall accept a `ModuleDescriptor` instance and return a JSON Schema dict suitable for use as an MCP Tool's `inputSchema`. The returned schema shall be a valid JSON Schema object with `"type": "object"` at the root level.

**Input/Trigger:** A `ModuleDescriptor` with a populated `input_schema` dict (as produced by Pydantic `model_json_schema()`).

**Expected Output:**
- A `dict[str, Any]` representing a valid JSON Schema.
- The root-level `"type"` key shall equal `"object"`.
- All `$ref` references within the schema shall be inlined (replaced with the referenced definition content).
- The `$defs` key (or `definitions` key) shall be removed from the returned schema.
- The `properties` key shall be preserved with all field definitions intact.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Empty `input_schema` (`{}`): Return `{"type": "object", "properties": {}}`.
- Schema with no `"type"` key but with `"properties"` key: Add `"type": "object"` to the returned schema.
- Schema with `"title"` key: Preserve the `"title"` key in the returned schema.
- Schema with `"required"` key: Preserve the `"required"` array in the returned schema.

**Error Conditions:**
- Circular `$ref` (e.g., definition A references definition B which references definition A): Raise `ValueError` with a message identifying the circular reference path.
- `$ref` pointing to a non-existent definition key: Raise `KeyError` with the missing definition name.
- Recursion depth exceeding 32 levels during `$ref` resolution: Raise `ValueError` indicating maximum recursion depth exceeded.

| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Traces to** | F-001 |

**Description:** The `SchemaConverter._inline_refs()` method shall resolve all `$ref` nodes that reference `$defs`-local definitions (format: `"$ref": "#/$defs/DefinitionName"`) by deep-copying the referenced definition and substituting it in place of the `$ref` node. After inlining, the `$defs` key shall be removed from the root schema.

**Input/Trigger:** A JSON Schema dict containing `$defs` and `$ref` nodes, as produced by Pydantic v2's `model_json_schema()`.

**Expected Output:**
- A new dict (original not mutated) with all `$ref` nodes replaced by their resolved definitions.
- Nested `$ref` within definitions shall also be resolved recursively.
- The `$defs` key shall not appear in the returned dict.
- The `definitions` key (legacy format) shall also be handled and removed if present.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Schema with zero `$ref` nodes: Return the schema unchanged (minus any empty `$defs`).
- Schema with deeply nested `$ref` (up to 32 levels): Resolve all levels.
- Schema with `$ref` in array items (`"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/X"}`): Resolve correctly.
- Schema with `$ref` in `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf` arrays: Resolve each branch.
- Schema with the same `$ref` used in multiple locations: Each location receives its own deep copy.

**Error Conditions:**
- Circular `$ref` chain: Raise `ValueError` with the cycle path (e.g., "Circular reference: A -> B -> A").
- Resolution depth exceeding 32: Raise `ValueError`.

#### FR-SCHEMA-003: Ensure root schema type is "object"

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-SCHEMA-003 |
| **Title** | Guarantee root-level type: object in converted schemas |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Traces to** | F-001 |

**Description:** The `SchemaConverter._ensure_object_type()` method shall verify that the root schema has `"type": "object"`. If the schema is empty or lacks a `"type"` key, it shall add the appropriate keys.

**Input/Trigger:** A JSON Schema dict (post-`$ref` inlining).

**Expected Output:**
- If schema is `{}`: Return `{"type": "object", "properties": {}}`.
- If schema has `"properties"` but no `"type"`: Return schema with `"type": "object"` added.
- If schema already has `"type": "object"`: Return schema unchanged.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Schema with `"type": "object"` and `"properties": {}`: Return as-is.
- Schema with `"type": "object"` and populated `"properties"`: Return as-is.

**Description:** The schema conversion for OpenAI `parameters` shall apply the same `$ref` inlining and `type: object` guarantee as MCP conversion (FR-SCHEMA-001 through FR-SCHEMA-003). The resulting schema shall be usable as the `"parameters"` value in an OpenAI tool definition.

**Input/Trigger:** A `ModuleDescriptor` with a populated `input_schema` dict.

**Expected Output:** A JSON Schema dict identical to the MCP `inputSchema` output (same inlining and normalization rules apply).

**Boundary Conditions:** Same as FR-SCHEMA-001.

**Error Conditions:** Same as FR-SCHEMA-001.

---

#### FR-SCHEMA-005: Convert output_schema for structured MCP responses

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-SCHEMA-005 |
| **Title** | Convert apcore output_schema for MCP structured output |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-013 |

**Description:** The `SchemaConverter.convert_output_schema()` method shall accept a `ModuleDescriptor` and return a cleaned JSON Schema dict for the output. The same `$ref` inlining logic shall apply. If the `output_schema` is empty (`{}`), the method shall return an empty dict `{}`.

**Input/Trigger:** A `ModuleDescriptor` with `output_schema` dict.

**Expected Output:**
- A JSON Schema dict with all `$ref` inlined and `$defs` removed.
- Empty dict `{}` if the input `output_schema` is empty.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Empty `output_schema` (`{}`): Return `{}`.
- Complex `output_schema` with `$defs`/`$ref`: Inline all references.

| **Traces to** | F-001 |

**Description:** The schema converter shall correctly preserve and pass through all JSON Schema types in property definitions: `"string"`, `"integer"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"array"`, `"object"`, and `"null"`. Union types (e.g., `"type": ["string", "null"]`) shall also be preserved.

**Input/Trigger:** A JSON Schema dict containing properties of any valid JSON Schema type.

**Expected Output:** All type declarations shall be preserved exactly in the output schema. No type information shall be lost or transformed.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Property with `"type": "array"` and `"items"` subschema: Preserve both.
- Property with `"type": "object"` and nested `"properties"`: Preserve the full nested structure.
- Property with `"enum"` values: Preserve the enum array.
- Property with `"const"` value: Preserve.
- Property with `"format"` (e.g., `"date-time"`, `"email"`): Preserve.

| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Traces to** | F-003 |

**Description:** The `ExecutionRouter.handle_call()` async method shall receive a tool name (string) and arguments (dict), invoke `Executor.call_async(tool_name, arguments)`, and return the result as a `CallToolResult`. The tool name equals the apcore `module_id`.

**Input/Trigger:** MCP `tools/call` request with `name` (string) and `arguments` (dict).

**Expected Output:** On success, a `CallToolResult` with `isError=False` and `content` containing a `TextContent` item whose `text` is the JSON-serialized module output dict.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Empty arguments dict `{}`: Pass `{}` to `Executor.call_async()`.

#### FR-EXEC-004: Support both sync and async module execute methods

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXEC-004 |
| **Title** | Support sync and async module execution via Executor.call_async() |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Traces to** | F-003 |

**Description:** The `ExecutionRouter` shall always use `Executor.call_async()`, which natively handles both synchronous and asynchronous module `execute()` methods. For sync modules, the Executor uses `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop. No additional bridging logic is required in apcore-mcp.

**Input/Trigger:** A tool call to any module (sync or async).

**Expected Output:** The module executes correctly regardless of whether its `execute()` method is sync or async.

**Boundary Conditions:**

| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-014 |

**Description:** The `serve()` function shall accept either a `Registry` or an `Executor` as its first argument. When an `Executor` is passed, `serve()` shall use that Executor for all tool call routing (preserving its ACL, middleware, and timeout configuration). When a `Registry` is passed, `serve()` shall create a default `Executor(registry)` internally.

**Input/Trigger:**
- `serve(executor)` where `executor` is an `Executor` instance.
- `serve(registry)` where `registry` is a `Registry` instance.

**Expected Output:**
- With Executor: The Executor's `registry` property is used for tool discovery; the Executor is used for `call_async()`.
- With Registry: A new `Executor(registry)` is created with default configuration.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Executor with ACL: ACL rules are enforced on all MCP tool calls.
- Executor with custom middleware: Middleware before/after hooks execute on all MCP tool calls.
- Executor with custom timeout: Timeout configuration applies to all MCP tool calls.

**Error Conditions:**
- First argument is neither `Registry` nor `Executor`: Raise `TypeError` with message "Expected Registry or Executor instance, got <type>".

**Description:** The internal tools dictionary in `RegistryListener` shall be protected by a `threading.Lock`. All reads (from `list_tools` handler on the async event loop thread) and writes (from Registry callbacks on potentially different threads) shall acquire the lock before accessing the dictionary.

**Input/Trigger:** Concurrent tool list read (MCP `tools/list` request) and write (registry event callback).

**Expected Output:** No data corruption. Reads always see a consistent snapshot.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- High-frequency register/unregister: All operations serialized via lock.

**Error Conditions:** None.

| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-016 |

**Description:** When a tool call is received by the `ExecutionRouter`, a DEBUG-level log message shall be emitted with format: "Tool call: {tool_name}".

**Input/Trigger:** MCP `tools/call` request received.

**Expected Output:** DEBUG log: "Tool call: image.resize".

**Boundary Conditions:** None.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-LOG-003: Log tool call errors at ERROR level

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-LOG-003 |

| **Title** | Logging verbosity configurable via Python logging module |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-016 |

**Description:** apcore-mcp shall not configure any log handlers or formatters by default (following Python library best practice). Users shall be able to control logging verbosity by configuring the `apcore_mcp` logger via standard Python `logging` module APIs. The `serve()` function's `log_level` parameter (FR-SERVER-010) provides a convenience shortcut.

**Input/Trigger:** `logging.getLogger("apcore_mcp").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`.

**Expected Output:** All DEBUG and above messages from apcore-mcp are emitted.

**Boundary Conditions:** None.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

**Expected Output:** Tool list contains only modules with "public" tag.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- No modules match: Zero tools registered, warning logged.
- All modules match: All tools registered.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-FILTER-002: Filter MCP tools by prefix in serve()

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-FILTER-002 |
| **Title** | serve() exposes only modules matching prefix filter |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-018 |

**Description:** When `serve(registry, prefix="api.")` is called, only modules whose `module_id` starts with `"api."` shall be registered as MCP tools.

**Input/Trigger:** `serve(registry, prefix="api.")`.

**Expected Output:** Tool list contains only modules with IDs starting with "api.".

**Boundary Conditions:**
- No modules match: Zero tools, warning logged.
- Prefix matches all: All tools registered.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-FILTER-003: Combine tag and prefix filters

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-FILTER-003 |

---

### 3.12 FR-HEALTH: Health Check Requirements

---

#### FR-HEALTH-001: Expose /health endpoint on HTTP transports

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-HEALTH-001 |
| **Title** | HTTP health check endpoint returns server status |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-019 |

**Description:** When the MCP Server runs with Streamable HTTP or SSE transport, a `GET /health` endpoint shall be available that returns HTTP 200 with a JSON body containing:
- `"status"`: string, always `"ok"`.
- `"module_count"`: integer, number of currently registered tools.
- `"uptime_seconds"`: float, seconds since server start.

**Input/Trigger:** HTTP `GET /health` request.

**Expected Output:** HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json`, body: `{"status": "ok", "module_count": 5, "uptime_seconds": 123.45}`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Server just started (< 1 second uptime): `uptime_seconds` is a small positive float.
- Zero tools registered: `module_count=0`.

### 3.13 FR-RESOURCE: MCP Resource Requirements

---

#### FR-RESOURCE-001: Expose module documentation as MCP Resources

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-RESOURCE-001 |
| **Title** | Modules with documentation exposed as MCP Resources |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-020 |

**Description:** Modules with a non-empty `documentation` field in their `ModuleDescriptor` shall be exposed as MCP Resources. Each resource shall be named `docs://{module_id}` and contain the documentation text as plain text content.

**Input/Trigger:** MCP `resources/list` or `resources/read` request.

**Expected Output:**
- `resources/list`: Returns list of resources, one per module with documentation.
- `resources/read` for `docs://image.resize`: Returns the documentation text.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Module with `documentation=None`: No resource generated.
- Module with `documentation=""` (empty string): No resource generated.
- Module with non-empty documentation: Resource generated with URI `docs://{module_id}`.

**Error Conditions:**
- Read request for non-existent resource URI: Return MCP error "Resource not found".

---

#### FR-RESOURCE-002: Modules without documentation do not generate resources

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-RESOURCE-002 |
| **Title** | No MCP Resource for modules lacking documentation |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-020 |

**Description:** Modules whose `ModuleDescriptor.documentation` is `None` or empty string `""` shall NOT produce an MCP Resource entry. Only modules with substantive documentation content shall appear in the resource list.

**Input/Trigger:** Module with `documentation=None` or `documentation=""`.

**Expected Output:** No resource entry for this module in `resources/list` response.

**Boundary Conditions:** None.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-STREAM-001: Streaming tool execution via notifications/progress

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-STREAM-001 |
| **Title** | Streaming tool execution via notifications/progress |
| **Priority** | P1 |

**Description:** When ALL of these conditions are met:
1. The Executor implements a `stream()` method
2. The client provides `_meta.progressToken` in the `tools/call` request
3. The module descriptor has `annotations.streaming = true`

Then the server SHALL:
1. Call `executor.stream(toolName, args)` instead of `executor.call(toolName, args)`
2. For each yielded chunk, send `notifications/progress` with:
   - `progressToken`: the client-provided token
   - `progress`: monotonically increasing integer (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - `message`: JSON-serialized chunk content
3. After iteration completes, return a standard `CallToolResult` with the accumulated complete result

When ANY condition is not met, fall back to normal atomic `executor.call()`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `progressToken` not provided: Normal atomic execution.
- Executor has no `stream()`: Normal atomic execution.
- Stream yields zero chunks: Return empty accumulated result `{}`.
- Stream throws mid-iteration: Map error via `ErrorMapper`, return error result.

---

### 3.14 FR-EXT: Extension Helpers

Extension helpers provide convenient wrappers for MCP-specific protocol features that module implementations can use during tool execution. These helpers abstract MCP protocol details so that module code does not need to interact with the MCP SDK directly.

---

#### FR-EXT-001: report_progress() sends MCP progress notifications

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXT-001 |
| **Title** | report_progress() sends MCP progress notifications to the client |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-005 |

**Description:** The `report_progress(context, progress, total=None, message=None)` helper function shall send an MCP `notifications/progress` notification to the connected client. The `context` parameter is the MCP server request context (made available to module execution via the apcore context pipeline). The `progress` parameter is a numeric value indicating current progress. The optional `total` parameter indicates the total expected value (enabling percentage calculation). The optional `message` parameter provides a human-readable progress description.

This function is a no-op (silently does nothing) when invoked outside an MCP context (e.g., when the module is called directly via `Executor.call()` without an MCP server).

**Signature:**
```python
async def report_progress(
    context: Any,
    progress: float,
    total: float | None = None,
    message: str | None = None,
) -> None: ...
```

**Input/Trigger:** Module implementation calls `await report_progress(context, 50, total=100, message="Processing image...")` during execution.

**Expected Output:** MCP `notifications/progress` notification sent to the client with `progress=50`, `total=100`, and `message="Processing image..."`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `total=None`: Progress notification sent without total (client cannot compute percentage).
- `message=None`: Progress notification sent without message text.
- No active MCP context (e.g., direct Executor call): No-op, no error raised.
- `progress` > `total`: Allowed (client may clamp or ignore).

**Error Conditions:**
- Silently no-ops when context has no MCP progress callback. No validation on progress value.

---

#### FR-EXT-002: elicit() solicits user input via MCP elicitation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXT-002 |
| **Title** | elicit() solicits user input from the MCP client |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-005 |

**Description:** The `elicit(context, message, requested_schema=None)` helper function shall send an MCP elicitation request to the connected client, soliciting user input. The `context` parameter is the MCP server request context. The `message` parameter is a human-readable prompt displayed to the user. The optional `requested_schema` parameter is a JSON Schema dict describing the expected shape of the user's response.

The function returns the client's elicitation response. If the MCP client does not support elicitation or the user declines, the function returns `None`.

Returns `None` when called outside MCP context (graceful no-op).

**Signature:**
```python
async def elicit(
    context: Any,
    message: str,
    requested_schema: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> Any | None: ...
```

**Input/Trigger:** Module implementation calls `await elicit(context, "Please confirm deletion", {"type": "object", "properties": {"confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}})` during execution.

**Expected Output:** MCP elicitation request sent to client. Returns the user's response dict (e.g., `{"confirmed": True}`) or `None` if declined/unsupported.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `requested_schema=None`: Client presents a free-form input prompt.
- Client does not support elicitation: Returns `None`.
- User declines or cancels: Returns `None`.
- Empty `message` (`""`): Allowed. No validation is performed on the message parameter.

**Error Conditions:**
- Called outside MCP context: Returns `None` (graceful no-op).

---

#### FR-EXT-003: MCP_PROGRESS_KEY and MCP_ELICIT_KEY constants

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXT-003 |
| **Title** | Module-level constants for MCP context keys |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Traces to** | F-005 |

**Description:** The `apcore_mcp` package shall export two string constants used as keys for storing MCP protocol objects in the apcore execution context:

- `MCP_PROGRESS_KEY` -- The context key under which the MCP progress reporting capability is stored. Used internally by `report_progress()` to retrieve the progress notification sender from the execution context.
- `MCP_ELICIT_KEY` -- The context key under which the MCP elicitation capability is stored. Used internally by `elicit()` to retrieve the elicitation sender from the execution context.

These constants allow advanced users to access the underlying MCP protocol objects directly when the helper functions do not cover their use case, while providing a stable, documented key name.

**Values:**
```python
MCP_PROGRESS_KEY: str = "_mcp_progress"
MCP_ELICIT_KEY: str = "_mcp_elicit"
```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Constants are module-level and immutable (plain `str`).
- Importing these constants does not require an active MCP server.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

### 3.15 FR-EXPLORER: MCP Tool Explorer Requirements

The MCP Tool Explorer is an optional, built-in browser UI that allows developers to browse, inspect, and test MCP tools. It is only available with HTTP-based transports and must be explicitly enabled.

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-001: Serve Explorer UI when explorer=True

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-001 |
| **Title** | Serve Explorer HTML UI at `explorer_prefix` when enabled |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** When `explorer=True` is passed to `serve()` (or `--explorer` on CLI) and the transport is HTTP-based (Streamable HTTP or SSE), the server SHALL mount a self-contained HTML page at `GET /explorer/` (or the configured `explorer_prefix`) that lists all registered tools with their descriptions and annotations. The `explorer_prefix` parameter is configurable (default `/explorer`).

**Input/Trigger:** `serve(registry, transport="streamable-http", explorer=True)`

**Expected Output:** `GET /explorer/` returns HTTP 200 with `Content-Type: text/html` containing the Explorer UI.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `explorer=True` with stdio transport: Explorer is silently ignored (no HTTP server).
- `explorer=False` (default): `GET /explorer/` is not mounted; server behaves as before.

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-002: JSON tool list endpoint

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-002 |
| **Title** | GET /explorer/tools returns JSON array of tool summaries |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** When the Explorer is enabled, `GET /explorer/tools` SHALL return a JSON array where each element contains `name` (string), `description` (string), and `annotations` (object with hint booleans).

**Expected Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "image-resize",
    "description": "Resize an image to specified dimensions",
    "annotations": {
      "readOnlyHint": false,
      "destructiveHint": false,
      "idempotentHint": true,
      "openWorldHint": true
    }
  }
]
```

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-003: JSON tool detail endpoint

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-003 |
| **Title** | GET /explorer/tools/<name> returns full tool detail with inputSchema |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** When the Explorer is enabled, `GET /explorer/tools/<name>` SHALL return a JSON object with full tool metadata including `name`, `description`, `annotations`, and `inputSchema`. Returns HTTP 404 if the tool name is not found.

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-004: Tool execution endpoint with allow_execute guard

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-004 |
| **Title** | POST /explorer/tools/<name>/call executes a tool via the Executor pipeline |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** When the Explorer is enabled and `allow_execute=True`, `POST /explorer/tools/<name>/call` SHALL accept a JSON body as tool input, execute the tool through the full Executor pipeline (ACL, validation, middleware), and return the result as JSON. When `allow_execute=False` (default), this endpoint SHALL return HTTP 403.

**Expected Output (success):**
```json
{"result": {"width": 800, "height": 600}}
```

**Error Conditions:**
- `allow_execute=False`: HTTP 403 with `{"error": "Tool execution is disabled"}`.
- Tool not found: HTTP 404 with `{"error": "Tool 'foo' not found"}`.
- Validation failure: HTTP 400 with `{"error": "Input validation failed: ..."}`.
- Execution error: HTTP 500 with `{"error": "..."}`.

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-005: Self-contained HTML asset with no external dependencies

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-005 |
| **Title** | Explorer HTML/JS is a single self-contained file |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** The Explorer UI SHALL be a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript, with no external CDN dependencies. This file is language-agnostic and can be shared across all `apcore-mcp-{lang}` implementations. Each language implementation embeds this file as a static asset in its package.

---

#### FR-EXPLORER-006: Configurable explorer_prefix parameter

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-EXPLORER-006 |
| **Title** | `explorer_prefix` parameter configurable with default `/explorer` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-026 |

**Description:** The `serve()` function SHALL accept an `explorer_prefix` parameter (default `/explorer`) that controls the URL prefix under which all Explorer endpoints are mounted. When set to a custom value (e.g., `/custom`), endpoints SHALL be available at `GET /custom/`, `GET /custom/tools`, `GET /custom/tools/<name>`, and `POST /custom/tools/<name>/call`.

**Input/Trigger:** `serve(registry, transport="streamable-http", explorer=True, explorer_prefix="/custom")`

**Expected Output:** All Explorer endpoints are mounted under `/custom/` instead of the default `/explorer/`.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Default value is `/explorer`.
- Prefix must start with `/`.
- Trailing slash is normalized (both `/explorer` and `/explorer/` are accepted).

### 3.16 FR-AUTH: JWT Authentication Requirements

#### FR-AUTH-001: Authenticator Protocol

**Description:** A `@runtime_checkable` Protocol `Authenticator` defines the interface for pluggable authentication backends.

**Interface:**
```
Authenticator.authenticate(headers: dict[str, str]) -> Identity | None
```

**Behavior:** Accepts lowercase header keys. Returns `Identity` on success, `None` on failure. Must not raise exceptions.

---

#### FR-AUTH-002: JWTAuthenticator

**Description:** Built-in JWT Bearer token authenticator using a JWT validation library (e.g., PyJWT for Python, jsonwebtoken for TypeScript).

**Configuration:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `key` | `str` | (required) | Secret key or public key for verification |
| `algorithms` | `list[str]` | `["HS256"]` | Allowed JWT algorithms |
| `audience` | `str \| None` | `None` | Expected `aud` claim |
| `issuer` | `str \| None` | `None` | Expected `iss` claim |
| `claim_mapping` | `ClaimMapping` | `ClaimMapping()` | Maps JWT claims to Identity fields |
| `require_claims` | `list[str]` | `["sub"]` | Claims that must be present |

**ClaimMapping fields:** `id_claim="sub"`, `type_claim="type"`, `roles_claim="roles"`, `attrs_claims=None`.

**Behavior:**
1. Extracts Bearer token from `Authorization` header (case-insensitive prefix).
2. Decodes and validates token using a JWT library.
3. Maps claims to `Identity(id, type, roles, attrs)`.
4. Returns `None` on any error (expired, bad signature, missing claims) -- never leaks token content.

---

#### FR-AUTH-003: AuthMiddleware

**Description:** ASGI middleware that validates requests and bridges identity to MCP handler via `ContextVar`.

**Configuration:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `app` | ASGI app | (required) | The wrapped application |
| `authenticator` | `Authenticator` | (required) | Authentication backend |
| `exempt_paths` | `set[str]` | `{"/health", "/metrics"}` | Paths that bypass auth |
| `exempt_prefixes` | `set[str]` | `{}` | Path prefixes that bypass auth |
| `require_auth` | `bool` | `True` | If False, unauthenticated requests proceed without identity |

**Behavior:**
1. Non-HTTP scopes (WebSocket, lifespan) pass through without authentication.
2. Exempt paths pass through without authentication.
3. Extracts headers from ASGI scope, calls `authenticator.authenticate(headers)`.
4. On success: sets `auth_identity_var` ContextVar, forwards request, resets in `finally`.
5. On failure + `require_auth=True`: returns 401 JSON with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`.
6. On failure + `require_auth=False`: forwards without identity (permissive mode).

---

#### FR-AUTH-004: Identity Pipeline Integration

**Description:** The authenticated identity flows from middleware through factory to router to Context.

**Data Flow:**
1. `AuthMiddleware` sets `auth_identity_var: ContextVar[Identity | None]`.
2. `MCPServerFactory.handle_call_tool` reads `auth_identity_var.get()`, adds to `extra["identity"]`.
3. `ExecutionRouter.handle_call` extracts `identity = extra.get("identity")`, passes to `Context.create(identity=identity)`.
4. `Executor.call_async()` receives Context with Identity -- ACL conditions (`identity_types`, `roles`) are now effective.

---

#### FR-AUTH-005: serve() and MCPServer authenticator Parameter

**Description:** Both `serve()` and `MCPServer.__init__()` accept an optional `authenticator` parameter. When provided with an HTTP transport, `AuthMiddleware` is applied to the Starlette app.

**Behavior:**
1. `authenticator` is ignored for stdio transport (no HTTP layer).
2. For HTTP transports, middleware list is built as `[(AuthMiddleware, {"authenticator": authenticator})]` and passed to transport manager.

---

#### FR-AUTH-006: CLI JWT Flags

**Description:** The CLI entry point provides flags for JWT configuration.

**Flags:**
| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--jwt-secret` | `str` | `None` | JWT secret key; enables JWT auth when set |
| `--jwt-algorithm` | `str` | `"HS256"` | JWT algorithm |
| `--jwt-audience` | `str` | `None` | Expected audience claim |
| `--jwt-issuer` | `str` | `None` | Expected issuer claim |
| `--jwt-key-file` | `path` | `None` | Path to PEM key file for JWT verification (Python only) |
| `--jwt-require-auth` / `--no-jwt-require-auth` | `bool` | `True` | Require JWT auth; `False` enables permissive mode |
| `--exempt-paths` | `str` | `None` | Comma-separated paths exempt from auth |

**Behavior:** When `--jwt-secret` (or `--jwt-key-file` in Python, or `APCORE_JWT_SECRET` env var) is provided, a `JWTAuthenticator` is created and passed to `serve(authenticator=...)`. Key resolution order: `--jwt-key-file` → `--jwt-secret` → `APCORE_JWT_SECRET` env var.

---

#### FR-AUTH-007: Explorer Authentication

**Description:** Explorer endpoints have a dual auth pattern: browsing is exempt from middleware, but tool execution enforces auth independently.

**Behavior:**
1. Explorer GET endpoints (page, tool list, tool detail) are exempt from auth middleware via `exempt_prefixes`.
2. Explorer POST `/explorer/tools/<name>/call` authenticates per-request when `authenticator` is provided to the Explorer handler.
3. On auth failure, returns 401 JSON with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header.
4. On auth success, sets `auth_identity_var` ContextVar for identity injection into the execution context.
5. When no authenticator is configured, tool execution proceeds without authentication.

### 3.17 FR-APPROVAL: Approval System Requirements (F-028)

---

#### FR-APPROVAL-001: ElicitationApprovalHandler

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-APPROVAL-001 |
| **Title** | ElicitationApprovalHandler bridges MCP elicitation to apcore approval system |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-028 |

**Description:** `ElicitationApprovalHandler` implements the `ApprovalHandler` protocol. It extracts the MCP elicit callback from `context.data[MCP_ELICIT_KEY]`, builds an approval message containing `moduleId`, `description`, and `arguments`, calls the elicit callback, and maps the response action to an `ApprovalResult`.

**Input/Trigger:** `requestApproval(request: ApprovalRequest)` called by the Executor approval gate.

**Expected Output:**
- `action == "accept"` → `ApprovalResult(status="approved")`
- Any other action → `ApprovalResult(status="rejected", reason="User action: {action}")`
- No context/callback → `ApprovalResult(status="rejected", reason="No context available...")`
- Callback throws → `ApprovalResult(status="rejected", reason="Elicitation request failed")`

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `context` is null or missing `data` → returns rejected
- Elicit callback is absent from `data` → returns rejected
- Elicit callback returns null → returns rejected
- `description` is null → substituted with empty string in message

**Error Conditions:** Never throws. All failure paths return rejected `ApprovalResult`.

#### FR-APPROVAL-002: Approval Error Codes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-APPROVAL-002 |
| **Title** | Three approval error codes added to ERROR_CODES / ErrorCodes |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-028 |

**Description:** `APPROVAL_DENIED`, `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`, `APPROVAL_PENDING` are added to the error code constants. `ErrorMapper` handles each with specific behavior.

**Input/Trigger:** ModuleError with code matching an approval error code.

**Expected Output:**
- `APPROVAL_PENDING`: Details narrowed to `{"approvalId": ...}` only. If no `approval_id`/`approvalId` in details, details set to null.
- `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`: `retryable: true` set on response. Details passed through.
- `APPROVAL_DENIED`: `reason` extracted from details. If present, details set to `{"reason": ...}`. Otherwise details passed through.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `APPROVAL_PENDING` with no `approval_id` key → `details: null`
- `APPROVAL_DENIED` with no `reason` key → original details passed through
- AI guidance fields from the error are also extracted and attached

**Error Conditions:** None.

#### FR-APPROVAL-003: CLI --approval Flag

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-APPROVAL-003 |
| **Title** | CLI --approval flag with four modes |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-028 |

**Description:** The CLI accepts `--approval <mode>` with choices: `elicit`, `auto-approve`, `always-deny`, `off` (default). The handler is passed to `serve()` as `approval_handler`/`approvalHandler`.

**Input/Trigger:** CLI argument `--approval <mode>`.

**Expected Output:**
- `elicit` → `ElicitationApprovalHandler()` instance
- `auto-approve` → `AutoApproveHandler()` from upstream `apcore`/`apcore-js`
- `always-deny` → `AlwaysDenyHandler()` from upstream `apcore`/`apcore-js`
- `off` → no handler (undefined/None)

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Invalid mode value → error with valid choices listed
- `auto-approve`/`always-deny` when upstream library doesn't export the handler → descriptive error

**Error Conditions:** Exits with error for invalid mode or missing upstream exports.

---

#### FR-AIGUIDANCE-001: AI Guidance Field Extraction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-AIGUIDANCE-001 |
| **Title** | ErrorMapper extracts AI guidance fields from ModuleError and maps to camelCase |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-029 |

**Description:** `ErrorMapper._attachAiGuidance()` reads `retryable`, `ai_guidance`, `user_fixable`, `suggestion` from the error object and writes them as `retryable`, `aiGuidance`, `userFixable`, `suggestion` (camelCase) on the MCP error response. Fields that are null/undefined or already set on the response are skipped.

**Input/Trigger:** Any ModuleError processed through `toMcpError()` (except internal/sanitized errors).

**Expected Output:** Non-null AI guidance fields appear as camelCase keys on the response dict/object.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- All four fields absent → no guidance fields on response
- Field already set (e.g., `retryable: true` on APPROVAL_TIMEOUT) → not overwritten
- Python reads snake_case from apcore, writes camelCase. TypeScript reads/writes camelCase.

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-AIGUIDANCE-002: AI Guidance in Error Text

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-AIGUIDANCE-002 |
| **Title** | Router appends AI guidance JSON to error text for agent parsing |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-029 |

**Description:** `ExecutionRouter._buildErrorText(errorInfo)` builds a text string from the error message. If any guidance fields are present (`retryable`, `aiGuidance`, `userFixable`, `suggestion`), they are collected into an object and JSON-stringified, then appended to the message with a `\n\n` separator.

**Input/Trigger:** Error response from ErrorMapper passed to `_buildErrorText()`.

**Expected Output:**
- With guidance: `"Error message\n\n{\"retryable\":true,\"aiGuidance\":\"...\"}"``
- Without guidance: `"Error message"` (plain, no JSON appendix)

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Empty guidance object (all fields undefined) → plain message, no JSON
- Guidance keys use camelCase in both Python and TypeScript output

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-AIGUIDANCE-003: AI Intent Metadata in Tool Descriptions

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-AIGUIDANCE-003 |
| **Title** | MCPServerFactory appends AI intent metadata from descriptor.metadata to descriptions |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-030 |

**Description:** `MCPServerFactory.buildTool()` reads `descriptor.metadata` for keys `x-when-to-use`, `x-when-not-to-use`, `x-common-mistakes`, `x-workflow-hints`. For each key with a non-empty string value, a labeled line is generated and appended to the tool description.

**Input/Trigger:** `buildTool(descriptor)` where `descriptor.metadata` contains one or more intent keys.

**Expected Output:** Description extended with `\n\n` separator followed by labeled lines:
```
Original description

When To Use: ...
When Not To Use: ...
Common Mistakes: ...
Workflow Hints: ...
```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- No metadata → description unchanged
- Non-string values (number, null, array) → silently ignored
- Empty string values → treated as falsy, ignored

**Error Conditions:** None.

---

#### FR-AIGUIDANCE-004: Streaming Annotation in Description Suffix

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | FR-AIGUIDANCE-004 |
| **Title** | AnnotationMapper includes streaming field in description suffix |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Traces to** | F-031 |

**Description:** `AnnotationMapper.toDescriptionSuffix()` includes `streaming=true` when `annotations.streaming` differs from the default value (`false`). The `streaming` field is added to the defaults dict with value `false`.

**Input/Trigger:** `toDescriptionSuffix(annotations)` where `annotations.streaming == true`.

**Expected Output:** `streaming=true` appended to the `[Annotations: ...]` suffix.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `streaming == false` (default) → not included in suffix
- `annotations == null` → empty string returned (unchanged behavior)

**Error Conditions:** None.

| **Measurement** | Unit test: register 5 modules, one with circular $ref; verify server starts with 4 tools |
| **Traces to** | F-001, F-005 |

**Description:** If schema conversion fails for one module during server startup (e.g., circular `$ref`), that module shall be skipped with a WARNING log, and the remaining modules shall be registered as tools. The server shall not fail to start due to a single module's schema error.

---

#### NFR-REL-003: Thread-safe tool list access

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | NFR-REL-003 |
| **Title** | Concurrent tool list access does not cause data corruption |

## 5. Use Cases

### UC-001: Start MCP Server via serve()

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-001 |
| **Title** | Start MCP Server via Python serve() call |
| **Primary Actor** | Module Developer (Maya) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-SERVER-001, FR-SERVER-004, FR-SERVER-005, FR-SERVER-006, FR-SERVER-011, FR-SCHEMA-001, FR-ANNOT-001 through FR-ANNOT-006 |

**Preconditions:**
1. apcore-mcp is installed (`pip install apcore-mcp`).
2. An apcore `Registry` exists with at least one registered module.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Developer creates a `Registry` and calls `registry.discover()`.
2. Developer calls `serve(registry)`.
3. System validates the `registry` parameter is a `Registry` instance.
4. System creates a default `Executor(registry)`.
5. System iterates over all modules via `registry.list()`.
6. For each module, system calls `registry.get_definition(module_id)` and builds an MCP `Tool` via `SchemaConverter` and `AnnotationMapper`.
7. System creates an MCP Server with name `"apcore-mcp"` and package version.
8. System registers `list_tools` and `call_tool` handlers on the server.
9. System starts stdio transport.
10. System logs: "apcore-mcp server started: N tools registered, transport=stdio".
11. System blocks until shutdown signal received.
12. System returns `None`.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: HTTP transport**: At step 2, developer calls `serve(registry, transport="streamable-http", port=9000)`. Steps 9-10 use Streamable HTTP transport instead of stdio.
- **A2: Executor passthrough**: At step 2, developer passes an `Executor` instance. Step 4 is skipped; the provided Executor is used directly.
- **A3: Custom server name**: At step 2, developer passes `name="my-tools"`. Step 7 uses the custom name.

**Exception Flows:**
- **E1: Invalid parameter type**: At step 3, the parameter is neither `Registry` nor `Executor`. System raises `TypeError`. Flow terminates.
- **E2: Invalid transport**: At step 2, `transport="websocket"`. System raises `ValueError`. Flow terminates.
- **E3: Port in use**: At step 9 (HTTP transport), the port is occupied. System raises `OSError`. Flow terminates.
- **E4: Schema conversion failure**: At step 6, one module has circular `$ref`. System logs warning, skips that module, continues with remaining modules.

**Postconditions:**
1. MCP Server was running and accepting connections during its lifetime.
2. All valid modules were registered as MCP tools.
3. Server has shut down cleanly.

### UC-002: MCP Client discovers tools

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-002 |
| **Title** | MCP Client discovers available tools |
| **Primary Actor** | AI Agent Builder (Alex) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-SERVER-011, FR-SCHEMA-001, FR-ANNOT-001 through FR-ANNOT-006 |

**Preconditions:**
1. MCP Server is running (UC-001 completed successfully).
2. An MCP client is connected to the server.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. MCP client sends `tools/list` request.
2. Server invokes `list_tools` handler.
3. Handler returns the list of `Tool` objects built during server startup.
4. Client receives a list where each tool has `name`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `annotations`.
5. Client displays the tools to the user or AI model.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: Empty registry**: At step 3, the list is empty. Client receives `[]`.
- **A2: After dynamic registration**: The tool list includes tools added after server start (per FR-DYNAMIC-001).

**Exception Flows:** None. The `tools/list` operation does not fail under normal conditions.

**Postconditions:**
1. Client has an accurate list of available tools with schemas and annotations.

---

### UC-003: MCP Client calls a tool (success)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

| **Title** | MCP Client successfully invokes a tool |
| **Primary Actor** | AI Agent Builder (Alex) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-EXEC-001, FR-EXEC-002, FR-EXEC-003, FR-EXEC-004 |

**Preconditions:**
1. MCP Server is running with at least one tool registered.
2. An MCP client has discovered the tools (UC-002).

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. MCP client sends `tools/call` request with `name="image.resize"` and `arguments={"width": 800, "height": 600}`.
2. Server invokes `call_tool` handler.
3. Handler delegates to `ExecutionRouter.handle_call("image.resize", {"width": 800, "height": 600})`.
4. Router calls `Executor.call_async("image.resize", {"width": 800, "height": 600})`.
5. Executor executes the full 10-step pipeline (context, safety, lookup, ACL, validation, middleware before, execute, output validation, middleware after, return).
6. Module returns `{"status": "ok", "path": "/out/resized.png"}`.
7. Router serializes output to JSON: `'{"status":"ok","path":"/out/resized.png"}'`.
8. Router returns `CallToolResult(content=[TextContent(type="text", text=<json>)], isError=False)`.
9. Client receives successful result.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: Async module**: At step 5, the module's `execute()` is a coroutine. Executor calls it directly (no thread bridging needed).
- **A2: Empty arguments**: At step 1, `arguments={}`. Router passes empty dict to Executor.

**Exception Flows:** See UC-004.

**Postconditions:**
1. Module executed successfully with full pipeline.
2. Client received JSON-serialized output.

2. Router calls `Executor.call_async()`.
3. Executor raises `SchemaValidationError` at pipeline step 5.
4. Router catches the error, delegates to `ErrorMapper.to_mcp_error()`.
5. ErrorMapper formats field-level errors: "Input validation failed:\n- width: Input should be a valid integer (int_type)".
6. Router returns `CallToolResult(isError=True, content=[TextContent(text=<error_message>)])`.
7. Client receives error response.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: ModuleNotFoundError**: Client calls non-existent tool `"foo.bar"`. Response: "Module not found: foo.bar".
- **A2: ACLDeniedError**: Executor ACL denies the call. Response: "Access denied" (no caller_id leaked).
- **A3: ModuleTimeoutError**: Module exceeds timeout. Response: "Module timed out after 30000ms".
- **A4: Unexpected Exception**: Module raises `RuntimeError`. Response: "Internal error occurred". Full trace logged at ERROR level.

**Exception Flows:** None. All errors are caught and returned as `CallToolResult`.

**Postconditions:**
1. Error response sent to client with `isError=True`.
2. For unexpected errors, full stack trace logged server-side.
3. No sensitive data leaked to client.

4. For each module, system obtains `ModuleDescriptor` and converts to OpenAI dict.
5. Module ID is normalized (dots replaced with `-`).
6. Schema is converted (same $ref inlining as MCP path).
7. System returns `list[dict]`.
8. Developer passes result to `openai.chat.completions.create(tools=tools)`.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: With annotations**: Developer calls `to_openai_tools(registry, embed_annotations=True)`. Annotation suffix appended to descriptions.
- **A2: With strict mode**: Developer calls `to_openai_tools(registry, strict=True)`. Schemas transformed for strict mode, `"strict": true` added.
- **A3: With filtering**: Developer calls `to_openai_tools(registry, tags=["image"], prefix="comfyui.")`. Only matching modules included.

**Exception Flows:**
- **E1: Invalid parameter type**: `TypeError` raised.
- **E2: Schema conversion failure for one module**: Module skipped with warning, others included.

**Postconditions:**
1. Developer has a list of OpenAI-compatible tool dicts.
2. Dicts are directly usable with OpenAI API.

### UC-006: Start MCP Server via CLI

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-006 |
| **Title** | Start MCP Server via command-line interface |
| **Primary Actor** | AI Agent Builder (Alex) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-CLI-001 through FR-CLI-008 |

**Preconditions:**
1. apcore-mcp is installed.
2. An extensions directory exists with apcore module files.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. User runs `python -m apcore_mcp --extensions-dir ./extensions`.
2. CLI parses arguments.
3. CLI validates `--extensions-dir` exists and is a directory.
4. CLI creates `Registry(extensions_dir="./extensions")`.
5. CLI calls `registry.discover()`.
6. CLI calls `serve(registry, transport="stdio")`.
7. Server starts and blocks.
8. User terminates with Ctrl+C.
9. Server shuts down, CLI exits with code 0.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: HTTP transport**: User adds `--transport streamable-http --port 9000`. Server starts on HTTP.
- **A2: Custom name and log level**: User adds `--name "my-tools" --log-level DEBUG`.

**Exception Flows:**
- **E1: Directory not found**: CLI prints error to stderr, exits code 1.
- **E2: Port in use**: Server fails to start, CLI exits code 2.
- **E3: Invalid arguments**: argparse prints error, CLI exits code 2.
- **E4: No modules discovered**: Warning logged, server starts with zero tools.

**Postconditions:**
1. Server ran and shut down cleanly.
2. Exit code reflects the outcome.

### UC-007: Dynamic module registration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-007 |
| **Title** | Add module to registry while MCP server is running |
| **Primary Actor** | Module Developer (Maya) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-DYNAMIC-001 through FR-DYNAMIC-004 |

**Preconditions:**
1. MCP Server is running (UC-001 completed).
2. An MCP client is connected.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Developer calls `registry.register("new.tool", module_instance)`.
2. Registry emits "register" event.
3. `RegistryListener._on_register()` callback fires.
4. Listener obtains `ModuleDescriptor` via `registry.get_definition("new.tool")`.
5. Listener builds MCP `Tool` via `MCPServerFactory.build_tool()`.
6. Listener adds tool to internal tools dict (under lock).
7. Listener triggers `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
8. MCP client re-fetches tool list and sees "new.tool".

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: Unregister module**: Developer calls `registry.unregister("old.tool")`. Listener removes tool from dict, sends notification.

**Exception Flows:**
- **E1: get_definition returns None**: Listener logs warning, does not add tool.
- **E2: build_tool raises ValueError**: Listener logs warning, does not add tool.

**Postconditions:**
1. MCP tool list updated to reflect registry state.
2. MCP client notified of change.

---

### UC-008: OpenAI tools with strict mode

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Use Case ID** | UC-008 |
| **Title** | Export OpenAI tool definitions with strict mode enabled |
| **Primary Actor** | AI Agent Builder (Alex) |
| **Traces to FRs** | FR-OPENAI-003 |

**Preconditions:**
1. apcore-mcp is installed.
2. Registry has modules with JSON Schema input schemas.

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Developer calls `to_openai_tools(registry, strict=True)`.
2. System iterates over modules.
3. For each module, system converts schema and applies strict mode transformations:
   a. Sets `additionalProperties: false` on all object types.
   b. Makes all properties required.
   c. Converts optional properties to nullable types.
   d. Strips `x-*` extensions and `default` values.
4. System adds `"strict": true` to each function definition dict.
5. System returns the list.
6. Developer uses result with `openai.chat.completions.create(tools=tools)`.
7. OpenAI model produces outputs exactly matching the schema.

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1: strict=False**: No strict mode transformations applied. No `"strict"` key in output.

**Exception Flows:**
- **E1: Schema incompatible with strict mode**: WARNING logged (e.g., "Schema for module 'x' uses additionalProperties: true, which is incompatible with strict mode"). Tool is still included with transformations applied.

**Postconditions:**
1. All tool definitions have `"strict": true`.
2. Schemas are strict-mode-compliant.

**Module:** `apcore_mcp`

**Signature:**
```python
async def elicit(
    context: Any,
    message: str,
    requested_schema: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> Any | None: ...
```

**Behavior:** Sends an MCP elicitation request and returns the user's response, or `None` if declined/unsupported.

**Exceptions:** None. Returns `None` when called outside MCP context (graceful no-op).

#### 8.1.5 Extension Helper Constants

**Module:** `apcore_mcp`

```python
MCP_PROGRESS_KEY: str = "_mcp_progress"
MCP_ELICIT_KEY: str = "_mcp_elicit"

### 10.3 apcore API Surface Used by apcore-mcp

The following apcore-python APIs are consumed by apcore-mcp. Verified against source code at `/Users/tercel/WorkSpace/aiperceivable/apcore-python/src/apcore/`.

```python
# Registry (apcore.registry.registry.Registry)
registry = Registry(extensions_dir="./extensions")
registry.discover() -> int
registry.list(tags=None, prefix=None) -> list[str]
registry.get(module_id) -> module | None
registry.get_definition(module_id) -> ModuleDescriptor | None
registry.iter() -> Iterator[tuple[str, Any]]
registry.on("register", callback)  # callback(module_id: str, module: Any)
registry.on("unregister", callback)
registry.count -> int
registry.module_ids -> list[str]

# Executor (apcore.executor.Executor)
executor = Executor(registry, middlewares=None, acl=None, config=None)
executor.call(module_id, inputs, context=None) -> dict
executor.call_async(module_id, inputs, context=None) -> dict  # async
executor.registry -> Registry
