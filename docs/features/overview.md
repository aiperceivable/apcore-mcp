## Execution Order

The implementation should follow this sequence to ensure core logic is stable before layering on transports and UI.

1. **Schema Converter** — Foundational for all protocol-compliant tool definitions.
2. **Annotation Mapper** — Required for both MCP and OpenAI adapters.
3. **Error Mapper** — Essential for clean feedback in both interfaces.
4. **Execution Router** — The bridge to the apcore Executor; depends on error-mapper.
5. **OpenAI Converter** — High-value, zero-dependency feature for immediate utility.
6. **MCP Server Factory** — Combines foundational modules into the core MCP server logic.
7. **Extension Bridge** — Wires apcore ExtensionManager into the factory and Executor before transports are layered on.
8. **Transport Manager** — Enables connectivity (stdio, HTTP) for the server.
9. **Registry Listener** — Adds dynamic capabilities once the base server is stable.
10. **Approval Handler** — Enhances safety for the operational server.
11. **Async Task Bridge** — Adds background task execution via apcore's AsyncTaskManager once approval semantics are in place.
12. **JWT Authenticator** — Secures the server for network deployments.
13. **Explorer UI** — Provides the final development and debugging interface.
