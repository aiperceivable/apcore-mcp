| [MCP Server Factory](./mcp-server-factory.md) | Builds the low-level MCP server instance. | schema-converter, annotation-mapper, execution-router | released-v0.14.0 |
| [OpenAI Converter](./openai-converter.md) | Exports modules as OpenAI-compatible tool definitions. | schema-converter, annotation-mapper | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Extension Bridge](./extension-bridge.md) | Wires apcore ExtensionManager into the MCP server pipeline. | mcp-server-factory, execution-router | released-v0.14.0 (`apply()` portion deferred — EB-1) |
| [Transport Manager](./transport-manager.md) | Manages stdio and network communication layers. | mcp-server-factory | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Registry Listener](./registry-listener.md) | Enables hot-reloading of tools on registry changes. | mcp-server-factory | released-v0.14.0 |
| [JWT Authenticator](./jwt-authenticator.md) | Secures HTTP transports using bearer tokens. | none | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Approval Handler](./approval-handler.md) | Implements human-in-the-loop confirmation via MCP. | execution-router | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Approval Handler (Phase B)](./approval-phase-b.md) | Storage-backed async approval flow with `StorageBackedApprovalHandler`, `InMemoryApprovalStore`, and `__apcore_approval_check` meta-tool. | approval-handler, execution-router | released-v0.16.0 |
| [Async Task Bridge](./async-task-bridge.md) | Routes async-hinted modules to apcore's AsyncTaskManager and exposes task meta-tools. | execution-router, error-mapper | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Explorer UI](./explorer-ui.md) | Web dashboard for inspecting and testing tools. | mcp-server-factory, execution-router | released-v0.14.0 |
| [Markdown](./markdown.md) | Renders `Tool.description` and OpenAI `function.description` as canonical apcore-toolkit Markdown for richer LLM tool-selection signal (`rich_description` / `richDescription` / `with_rich_description`). | apcore-toolkit 0.6+ (optional) | released-v0.15.0 |
| [System Management Extension](./system-management-extension.md) | Unofficial MCP extension (`com.aiperceivable/management`) advertising the `system.*` management surface's shape in `initialize`; Phase A only. | mcp-server-factory | released-v0.19.0 (Phase A) |
| [ACL Builder](./acl-builder.md) | Builds an `apcore.ACL` from the `mcp.acl` Config Bus section; owns the Config-Bus-shaped validation, wraps apcore's §6.2.1 pattern-array rejections with a rule index, and reports tier-2 never-matches findings at startup. | apcore 0.30.0 | released-v0.20.0 |
| [OpenAPI Backend](./openapi-backend.md) | Third backend source — turns an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 document into MCP tools via apcore-toolkit's `OpenAPIScanner` + `HTTPProxyRegistryWriter`. | apcore-toolkit 0.13.0, schema-converter, annotation-mapper, mcp-server-factory | released-v0.20.0 |

## Execution Order

The implementation should follow this sequence to ensure core logic is stable before layering on transports and UI.

1. **Schema Converter** — Foundational for all protocol-compliant tool definitions.
2. **Annotation Mapper** — Required for both MCP and OpenAI adapters.
3. **Error Mapper** — Essential for clean feedback in both interfaces.
4. **Execution Router** — The bridge to the apcore Executor; depends on error-mapper.
5. **OpenAI Converter** — High-value, zero-dependency feature for immediate utility.
6. **MCP Server Factory** — Combines foundational modules into the core MCP server logic.
7. **Extension Bridge** — Wires apcore ExtensionManager into the factory and Executor before transports are layered on.
8. **Transport Manager** — Enables connectivity (stdio, HTTP) for the server.
9. **Registry Listener** — Adds dynamic capabilities once the base server is stable.
10. **Approval Handler** — Enhances safety for the operational server.
10a. **Approval Handler (Phase B)** — Adds storage-backed async approval polling and the `__apcore_approval_check` meta-tool.
11. **Async Task Bridge** — Adds background task execution via apcore's AsyncTaskManager once approval semantics are in place.
12. **JWT Authenticator** — Secures the server for network deployments.
13. **Explorer UI** — Provides the final development and debugging interface.

### Added in 0.20.0

14. **ACL Builder** — Realigns `mcp.acl` validation to PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.2.1's normative order, wraps apcore's pattern-array rejections with a rule index, and adds the tier-2 startup diagnostic. Depends on nothing else in this list; ship it before the OpenAPI Backend, whose safety guidance leans on it.
15. **OpenAPI Backend** — Composes apcore-toolkit's scanner and HTTP proxy writer into a `Registry`. Depends on the Schema Converter, Annotation Mapper and MCP Server Factory already being stable; introduces no new execution path.
